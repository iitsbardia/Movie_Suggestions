Movie & TV Playlists
A lightweight web app for organizing and browsing movie and TV show recommendations by vibes and categories. The data is stored locally in a CSV file, making it easy to add or update playlists.

Features
Dynamic Playlists: Organizes movies and TV shows into playlists based on their vibe or category.
Local Data: Uses a CSV file for storing data, so you can easily update or modify playlists without changing the code.
Responsive Design: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Quick Access: Links to IMDb for details and a "Play Online" button for streaming (URLs to be added manually).
